1) Make it so we pass sender IP to receiver functionality so we only parse packets from the anticipated sender
2) Fix firewall so it doesn't modidy packet header but we do change who its from so it sends
# Try to manually change the sender ip ourselves
        # Change source ip
        #print(str(pkt[15])) # this is the last octet
        #print(str(pkt[20:22])) # this is the source port
        #pkt[15] = b'\x84' # this is 132 (last octet of firewall)
        #pkt[20:22] = b'\x07\x83' # this is 1923 (source port of sending for firewall)
        # Change source port
